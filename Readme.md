# Bayesian Networks for Neuroscience

<h2>Overview</h2>
Many research fields have benefit from the flexibility and expressiveness of the Bayesian Network framework - medicine, economics, artificial intelligence, social science, and many more. Still, Bayesian networks have failed to penetrate the field of neuroscience, where they could be of incredible use. With that in mind, this project is aimed at making Bayesian Networks more accessible to neuroscientists. The motivation for this project is very much derived from the review paper by Bielza and Larranaga - "Bayesian networks in neuroscience: a survey."

As it relates to neuroscience, this code base aims to perform the following general tasks:
- Association Discovery : looking for relationships among variables of interest.
- Supervised Classification : predicted class labels of new data from training data.
- Clustering : assigning data into clusters of similar observations

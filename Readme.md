# Bayesian Networks for Neuroscience

<h2>Overview</h2>
Many research fields have benefit from the flexibility and expressiveness of the Bayesian Network framework - medicine, economics, artificial intelligence, social science, and many more. Still, Bayesian networks have failed to penetrate the field of neuroscience, where they could be of incredible use. With that in mind, this project is aimed at making Bayesian Networks more accessible to neuroscientists. The motivation for this project is very much derived from the review paper by Bielza and Larranaga - "Bayesian networks in neuroscience: a survey."

As it relates to neuroscience, this code base aims to perform the following general tasks:
- <b><i>Function Connectivity Mapping</i></b>
	- looking for network-based relationships among variables of interest. This is
known in the more general case as "Association Discovery".
- <b><i>Feature Selection</i></b> 
	- choosing the appropriate features (variables) to use in classifying a target variable, or otherwise
reducing the dimensionality of a large dataset.
- <b><i>Supervised Classification</i></b>
	- predict class labels of new data from training data.
- <b><i>Unsupervised Classification</i></b>
	- learning from data where the ground truth is unknown. One example of this task is "clustering" - assigning data into clusters of similar observations.
- <b><i>Inference</i></b>
	- answering marginal or conditional probability queries, such as "what is the probability a person will develop dimentia given that he/she is 60 years old and had a stroke within the last five years?"

<h2>Data</h2>

The goal is to achieve full availability of state-of-the-art Bayesian network functionality for seamless use with all types of neuroscience data.
- Morphological Data
- Electrophysiological Data
- Genomics/Proteomics/Transcriptomics Data
- Neuroimaging Data
	- fMRI
	- MRI
	- EEG
- Others
	- ECoG, EMG, JME, TCD, DTI, PET

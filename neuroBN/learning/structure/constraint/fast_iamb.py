For Feature Selection (from [1]):
	"A principled solution to the feature selection problem is
	to determine a subset of attributes that can "shield" (render
	independent) the attribute of interest from the effect of
	the remaining attributes in the domain. Koller and Sahami
	[4] first showed that the Markov blanket of a given target attribute
	is the theoretically optimal set of attributes to predict
	its value...
	
	Because the Markov blanket of a target attribute T renders
	it statistically independent from all the remaining attributes
	(see the Markov blanket definition below), all information
	that may influence its value is stored in the values
	of the attributes of its Markov blanket. Any attribute
	from the feature set outside its Markov blanket can be effectively
	ignored from the feature set without adversely affecting
	the performance of any classifier that predicts the
	value of T"

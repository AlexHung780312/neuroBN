Exact Marginal Inference
************************

Perform exact marginal inference over a BayesNet object,
with or without evidence.

Eventually, there will be a wrapper function "marginal_exact"
for all of the algorithms, and users can choose their method as
an argument to that function.

Exact Marginal Inference Algorithms
-----------------------------------
	
	- Sum-Product Variable Elimination
	- Clique Tree Message Passing (Belief Propagation)

	"""
	Perform Belief Propagation (Message Passing) over a Clique Tree. This
	is sometimes referred to as the "Junction Tree Algorithm" or
	the "Hugin Algorithm".

	It involves an Upward Pass (see [1] pg. 353) along with
	Downward Pass (Calibration) ([1] pg. 357) if the target involves
	multiple random variables - i.e. is a list

	Steps Involved:
		1. Build a Clique Tree from a Bayesian Network
			a. Moralize the BN
			b. Triangulate the graph
			c. Find maximal cliques and collapse into nodes
			d. Create complete graph and make edge weights = sepset cardinality
			e. Using Max Spanning Tree to create a tree of cliques
		2. Assign each factor to only one clique
		3. Compute the initial potentials of each clique
			- multiply all of the clique's factors together
		4. Perform belief propagation based on message passing protocol.

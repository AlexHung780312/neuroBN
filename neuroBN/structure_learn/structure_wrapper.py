	"""
	Wrapper for Bayesian network structure learning.

	Arguments
	---------
	*data* : a nested numpy array

	*method* : a string
		Which structure learning algorithm to use.

	*feature_selection* : an integer (optional - default "None")
		If *feature_selection* argument is supplied with an integer,
		it will assume that structure learning is
		being used for feature selection only - so the 
		markov blanket of the *feature_selection* passed-in value will
		be calculated and returned. Note, this is only
		relevant for a few constraint-based structure
		learning algorithms

	Returns
	-------
	*bn* : a structure learned BayesNet object

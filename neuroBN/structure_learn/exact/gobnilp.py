"""
GOBNILP Solver for Exact Bayesian network
Structure Learning with Integer Linear
Optimization.

This code relies on the "pyGOBN" package, which
implements a Python wrapper for the GOBNILP
project - which itself builds on the SCIP
Optimization engine for building Integer Linear
Programs to solve the BN structure learning problem
EXACTLY.

Th pyGOBN code - linked in this file - allows the user
to create or alter a vast number of global parameter settings 
(i.e. wall-time, parent limits, sparsity, equivalent 
sample size, etc), along with various network constraints 
(i.e. required edges, disallowed edges, and independence
requirements).
